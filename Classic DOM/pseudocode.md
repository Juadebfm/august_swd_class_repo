// If everything is okay, render the country cards
// Handle errors if something goes wrong
// Show an error message in the "countries-container" div
// Function to create one card for a country
// Check if the `country` object is valid
// If it is, create a card with the country's name and population
// Add Tailwind CSS classes to style the card
// Fill the card with information about the country
// Return the card element
// Function to render all country cards into the container
// Get the container div where we will add the cards
// Clear any existing content in the container
// Loop through the list of countries and create a card for each one
// Create a single card for the country
// Add the card to the container
// Fetch and render countries when the page is fully loaded

## topics to know

1. Basic JavaScript Concepts
   Variables: Understanding const, let, and var to declare and store data.
   Data Types: Knowing the difference between string, number, object, array, etc.
   Conditionals: Using if, else, and logical operators (&&, ||, !) for decision-making.
   Functions: Understanding how functions work, including their declaration (function) and invocation.
   Loops: Familiarity with forEach, for, or while to iterate over arrays or objects.
   Error Handling: Basics of try, catch, and throw for managing errors.
2. DOM Manipulation
   Understanding the DOM: Knowing what the Document Object Model is and how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements.
   Selecting Elements: Using document.getElementById or querySelector to access DOM elements.
   Creating and Modifying Elements: Using document.createElement, setting innerHTML, and appending elements to the DOM with appendChild.
   Event Listeners: Knowing how to listen for events like DOMContentLoaded and react to them.
3. Asynchronous JavaScript
   Promises: Understanding what a promise is and how then works (although async/await simplifies it).
   Async/Await: Knowing how to write asynchronous code to handle data fetching or delays.
   Error Handling in Async Code: Using try and catch with async functions to catch errors.
4. Working with Arrays
   Basic Array Operations: Understanding push, pop, map, forEach, etc.
   Looping Over Arrays: Knowing how to iterate over an array and perform actions on each element.
   Common Array Methods:
   Array.isArray(): To check if a value is an array.
   instanceof Array: Alternative to check if a value is an array.
5. Template Literals
   Using backticks ` to create multi-line strings and embed variables using ${}.
6. Object Basics
   Accessing Properties: Using dot notation (obj.property) and bracket notation (obj["property"]).
   Default Values: Using || to set fallback values (e.g., country.capital || 'N/A').
7. CSS and Classes
   Basic Tailwind CSS: Understanding how Tailwind classes style elements.
   Dynamic Classes: Understanding how classes are added dynamically via className.
8. Error Handling Basics
   Understanding why and how errors occur.
   Using console.error for debugging and displaying custom error messages.
9. Event Handling
   Knowing how to use addEventListener to trigger functions when specific events occur, like DOMContentLoaded.
10. Working with APIs or Data
    Understanding what data looks like when fetched from an API (e.g., JSON objects and arrays).
    Knowing how to access and use nested properties in objects (e.g., country.population).
